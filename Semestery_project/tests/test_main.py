Code Analysis

Objective:
The objective of the 'home' function is to render the home page of the application and redirect the user to the transaction index page if they are authenticated.

Inputs:
The 'home' function does not take any inputs.

Flow:
1. The function checks if the user is authenticated using the 'current_user.is_authenticated' method.
2. If the user is authenticated, the function redirects them to the transaction index page using the 'redirect' method and the 'url_for' function.
3. If the user is not authenticated, the function renders the 'main/home.html' template using the 'render_template' method.

Outputs:
The main outputs of the 'home' function are:
- If the user is authenticated, they are redirected to the transaction index page.
- If the user is not authenticated, the 'main/home.html' template is rendered.

Additional aspects:
- The 'home' function is decorated with the '@main.route' decorator, which specifies the URL routes for the function.
- The 'home' function is part of the 'main' blueprint, which is imported from the '.main' module.
- The 'home' function is imported and registered in the application factory function.
