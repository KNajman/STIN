Code Analysis

Objective:
The objective of the 'home' function is to handle the GET and POST requests for the home page of the web application. It allows the user to add a new note to the database and displays the notes added by the user.

Inputs:
- GET and POST requests
- 'note' input from the HTML form

Flow:
- Check if the request method is POST
- If yes, get the 'note' input from the HTML form
- Check if the length of the note is less than 1, if yes, flash an error message
- If the length of the note is greater than or equal to 1, create a new note object with the provided schema and add it to the database
- Flash a success message
- Render the home.html template with the current user object

Outputs:
- Flash messages (success or error)
- Rendered home.html template with the current user object

Additional aspects:
- The function is decorated with the 'login_required' decorator to ensure that only authenticated users can access the home page
- The function uses the 'Note' model to create a new note object and add it to the database using SQLAlchemy
- The function uses the 'render_template' function to render the home.html template with the current user object.
